 * Linear operator in that:
 * L(a + b) = L(a) + L(b)
 *
 * In other words, we can compute L(b - a) without computing L(a) first. `a`
 * represents some prior state of the database. `b - a` is a diff to the database.
 *
 * - map, filter, concat are linear
 *
 * Reduce and join are non-linear since they must use the prior state `a`, not just the diff `b - a`, in their
 * computations.
