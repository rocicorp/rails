/**
 * Forwards Replicache changes to ZQL sources so they
 * can be fed into any queries that may exist.
 *
 * Maintains derived orderings of sources as well.
 *
 * If someone runs a query that has an order-by we need to scan the entire collection
 * in order to sort it.
 * To save future work, we save the result of that sort and keep it up to date.
 *
 * This helps:
 * 1. When revisting old queries that were sorted or paging through results
 * 2. When many queries are sorted by the same field
 * 3. When joining sources on a field that we have pre-sorted
 *
 * And shares the work between queries.
